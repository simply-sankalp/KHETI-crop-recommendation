# KHETI: Knowledge-driven Harvest for Ecological Transformation and Innovation

## Overview
**KHETI** is an AI-powered framework that analyzes soil quality, fertility, and market data to recommend optimal crop choices for farm zones. The aim is to maximize profit, minimize crop loss, and promote sustainable farming practices.

## Project Goals
- Analyze soil and environmental data.
- Zone farm areas based on soil characteristics.
- Recommend crops to optimize yield and profitability.

## Current Status
- Soil fertility and quality metrics defined.
- Preliminary zoning and profit optimization approach outlined.
- Future work includes crop loss minimization strategies.
